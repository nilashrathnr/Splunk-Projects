SPLUNK MINI-PROJECT-01: "Failed SSH Login Detection and Alerting with Splunk SIEM"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF SIEM, AND TO HAVE A HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE. THUS THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED IN MY LOCAL MACHINE.

Use Case: Detect brute-force or suspicious login attempts
Summary:
This project is useful to record application login logs, detect multiple failed login attempts from the same user or IP, and Create alerts and visualizations.
I've used Splunk to get visualized data and do administrative tasks, and Created SPL to filter for failed login codes.

Note: I've used Vmware which hosts Kali Linux, Splunk tool installed in Windows, and files stored in my Windows.
Linux is used coz I did login attempts there, and stored the login attempts in a shared folder named file in the kali linux.
So, long story short You need a VM that has an Ubuntu OS, and your local machine that is windows, and splunk to complete this project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step-by-Step Guideline:

Phase 1: Pre-requiites
1. Splunk Software (Can be downloaded for free(Trial Period 60 days))
2. Virtual Machine (Can be downloaded for free)
3. Kali Linux (Recommended, can be downloaded for free)

Phase 2: Installation
1. Splunk should be installed in your local machine (Windows preferred)
2. In your VM you need to do some additional works, so close the VM if it's ON.
	2.1 Now follow these steps:
		Go to: VM > Settings > Shared Folders > + (Add New Folder)> Folder Path--> Your system drive path/foldername (create this folder beforehand in the file manager)> click enable checkbox, and make 		sure read-only checkbox is unchecked. > click ok to apply the settings. > boot your Linux VM.

3. Mount Shared Folder in Linux VM
sharedlogs is name given to the file, it's user-defined.
		>/ sudo mkdir /mnt/sharedlogs 
		>/ sudo mount -t fuse.vmhgfs-fuse .host:/sharedlogs /mnt/sharedlogs -o allow_other
		>/ ls /mnt/hgfs (checks whether the file mounted is available)--> if it shows "sharedlogs" file then it's mounted successfully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(IF ERROR sharelogs not shown)-->Fix the GPG Key Error for Kali Repositories:
	Add the Missing GPG Key: 
	>/ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ED65462EC8D5E4C5
	>/ sudo apt update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 3: SSH Installation in your Kali Linux (VM)
1. INSTALL OPENSSH-SERVER: 
	>/ sudo apt install openssh-server

Why we need SSH? 
We need openssh-server to enable SSH service and generate real authentication logs for Failed login attempts, Successful logins, and Brute-force detections.
What's next?
Push those logs into Splunk for real-time monitoring project.

2. ENABLE AND START THE SSH SERVICE: 
	>/sudo systemctl enable ssh
	>/sudo systemctl start ssh
3. CHECK THE STATUS:
	>/ sudo systemctl status ssh 
	You should see something like--> Active: active (running)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 4: SSH logins in KALI
1. Simulate Failed SSH Logins in Kali
	>/ sudo ssh invaliduser@localhost  (For the first time, fingerprint y/n arises enter yes)
 	Repeat it a few times with wrong credentials. This generates lines like: Failed password for invaliduser from 127.0.0.1 port 22 ssh2
				(Do this with 2 more users like sample@localhost, sample2@localhost)		

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 5: Export SSH log from kali to local machine
1. Save the log output to a file:
>/ sudo journalctl -u ssh > ~/ssh_logs.log  (ssh_logs is user defined)
>/ cat ~/ssh_logs.log  (To confirm whether the file exists)

2. Copy auth.log to Shared Folder
>/ sudo cp ~/ssh_logs.log /mnt/hgfs/sharedlogs/

ONCE FILE IS IN yourdrive:\foldername\sharedlogs\ssh_logs.log, AND SINCE WE HAVE ALREADY CONFIGURED SPLUNK TO MONITOR THAT FOLDER, SPLUNK AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS AND UPDATES THE NEW FILE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 6: Configure Splunk to Monitor the Log File

1. Open your browser â†’ go to http://localhost:8000 (Log in to Splunk) 
From the top menu: > Settings > Add Data > Choose: Monitor > Files & Directories > Click next
			Set path to: yourdrivelocationwith ssh_logs.log location
			Set Source type: Manual
			Set Host: Rath
			Set Index: main (or create a new one if you prefer)
			Click Review > Submit

2. Verify Log Data in Splunk:
			Go to the Search & Reporting App:
			Use this SPL in the Search & Reporting app: index=main sourcetype=syslog (You should see your auth.log entries being displayed.)

Try this too:
Go to Splunk Search, and use:
                        index=main "Failed password"

SIMULATION OF FAILED LOGIN DETECTION SYSTEM USING SPLUNK IS SUCCESSFULLY FINISHED!
