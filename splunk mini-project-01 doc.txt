Step 1: Disable "Read-only" in Shared Folder Properties
Go to the shared folder properties on the Windows host:

Navigate to D:/Ethical Hacking/sharedlogs.

Right-click on the folder and select Properties.

Uncheck the "Read-only" checkbox:

In the Attributes section, uncheck the Read-only box.

Click Apply and then OK.

Recheck folder permissions:

Ensure that you have full permissions for the folder.

🔧 Step 2: Re-mount the Shared Folder in Kali
Unmount the shared folder (if already mounted):


sudo umount /mnt/hgfs
Mount the shared folder again:


sudo vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs -o allow_other
Verify the folder is accessible:

ls /mnt/hgfs
🛠️ Step 3: Try Copying the File Again
Now, try copying the file to the shared folder again:


sudo cp ~/auth.log /mnt/hgfs/sharedlogs/auth.log
With the "Read-only" option disabled, this should work without the Input/output error.

Let me know how it goes!

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Enable Log Collection:

	Share Linux VM Logs with Host and Monitor Locally (Quick but Less Scalable)


	✅ Shared Folder Setup: Step-by-Step Guide:

		Step 0: Prerequisites

		You’re using VirtualBox

		Splunk is installed on your host OS (Windows/Linux)

		Your Linux VM (e.g., Ubuntu) has Guest Additions installed

		Step 1: Share the Log Folder from VM to Host
			In VirtualBox:
			Shut down your Linux VM.

			Go to: VM > Settings > Shared Folders > + (Add New Folder)> Folder Path--> D:/Ethical Hacking/Sharedlogs(create a folder beforehand in the file manager)> click 			enable checkbox, and make sure read-only checkbox is unchecked. > click ok to apply the settings. > boot your Linux VM.
		Step 2: Mount Shared Folder in Linux VM
			sudo mkdir /mnt/sharedlogs
			sudo mount -t fuse.vmhgfs-fuse .host:/sharedlogs /mnt/sharedlogs -o allow_other
			ls /mnt/hgfs (checks whether the file mounted is available)--> if it shows "sharedlogs" file then it's mounted successfully.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(IF ERROR PERSISTS)-->Fix the GPG Key Error for Kali Repositories:
	Add the Missing GPG Key: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys ED65462EC8D5E4C5
	sudo apt update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL OPENSSH-SERVER:  sudo apt install openssh-server

We need openssh-server to:

	Enable SSH service

	Generate real authentication logs for:

		Failed login attempts

		Successful logins

		Brute-force detections

	Push those logs into Splunk for your real-time monitoring project

ENABLE AND START THE SSH SERVICE: 
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
CHECK THE STATUS:  sudo systemctl status ssh --->You should see something like--> Active: active (running)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 		

		Step 3: Export SSH Log From Kali
			sudo journalctl -u ssh.service > ~/auth.log
			sudo cp ~/auth.log /mnt/hgfs/sharedlogs/auth.log
			(This will generate SSH logs and place them inside the shared folder that Splunk can access.)


		Step 4: Add This Log File as a Data Source in Splunk
			Open your browser → go to http://localhost:8000 (Log in to Splunk) > From the top menu: > Settings > Add Data
			Choose: Monitor > Files & Directories > Click next
			Set path to: D:\Ethical Hacking\kali\sharedlogs\auth.log
			Set Source type: 

			Set Host: Rath

			Set Index: main (or create a new one if you prefer)

			Click Review > Submit

		Step 5: Verify Log Data in Splunk
			Go to the Search & Reporting App:
			Use this SPL in the Search & Reporting app: index=main sourcetype=syslog (You should see your auth.log entries being displayed.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional: Automate Log Copying in Kali
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're happy with the setup, automate the log copy every minute:

Open crontab:

sudo crontab -e
Add this line:
*/1 * * * * cp /var/log/auth.log /mnt/sharedlogs/auth.log
									
------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOW WE GO TO Phase 1: Parse & Filter the Right Logs in the search field 

		index=main source="*auth.log" "Failed password" (This will show all failed login attempts.)
			
			Step 1: Simulate Failed SSH Logins in Kali
				sudo ssh invaliduser@localhost  (For the first time, fingerprint y/n arises enter yes)
				Repeat it a few times with wrong credentials. This generates lines like: Failed password for invaliduser from 127.0.0.1 port 22 ssh2
				(Do this with 2 more users like kai@localhost, nilash@localhost)		

			Step 2: Copy auth.log to Shared Folder
				Overwrite the old file with new logs-->
					sudo cp /var/log/auth.log ~/auth.log
					sudo cp ~/auth.log /mnt/hgfs/sharedlogs/auth.log

			Step 3: Splunk Ingests the Log Automatically
			(Since the Directory Monitor is already configured in Splunk for D:\Ethical Hacking\sharedlogs, it will auto-ingest auth.log.)

				Wait a few seconds, then search in Splunk:  index=main "Failed password"
						
			[ OR if any error occur like no results, go for the below step 3: ]

			Step 3:Export logs for Splunk
				Since we need to copy logs to a file Splunk can monitor, export the output:

				sudo journalctl -u ssh > ~/ssh_logs.log
				Then copy that file to your VM shared folder: sudo cp ~/ssh_logs.log /mnt/hgfs/sharedlogs/

				-----On Kali Linux (your system), auth.log does not exist by default. Instead, Kali uses journalctl for logs. So we couldn't rely on 							/var/log/auth.log.----------

				NOW REPEAT STEP 1: SIMULATION OF FAILED LOGINS
				STEP 2:Regenerate the file for Splunk:

				sudo journalctl -u ssh > ~/ssh_logs.log
				sudo cp ~/ssh_logs.log /mnt/hgfs/sharedlogs/

			Step 4:Go to Splunk Search, and use:


				index=main "Failed password"
